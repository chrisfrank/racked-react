# Racked React

Handle HTTP requests in React

## Why?

I love React's declarative, component-based approach to building user
interfaces. Turns out it's also a delightful way to handle HTTP requests.

```jsx
// an app that lists songs on localhost:3000/

// boilerplate
const React = require('react');
const db = require('your-favorite-database-library');

// components from racked-react:
// <Hold> for async I/O
// <Response> for writing HTTP responses
// `racked` for connecting your App to http.createServer, express, or whatever
const { Response, Hold, racked } = require('racked-react');

const App = ({ request }) => (
  <Hold until={fetchSongs}>
    {songs => (
      <Response status={200} headers={{ 'X-Hello-From': 'racked-react' }}>
        <h1>A list of songs:</h1>
        <ul>
          {songs.map(song => (
            <li key={song.id}>
              <a href={song.mp3_url}>{song.name}</a>
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </Response>
    )}
  </Hold>
);

const fetchSongs = () => db.select('*').from('songs);

racked(App).listen(3000);
```

## Why not?

If your app delivers static HTML and doesn't need to write data, you'll probably
be happier with [next.js][next] or [after.js][after] than with racked-react.

Though you _can_ build static sites in racked-react, it's aimed at building REST
APIs, traditional CRUD apps, and other I/O-heavy projects. Its main advantage
over Next and After is that it lets you asynchronously read and write data on
the server, without statically declaring your routes in advance.

## Installation

Via npm or yarn:

`npm install --save racked-react`

or

`yarn add racked-react`

## Setup

Skip to the [next section](#setup) if you already have a server-side JSX/Babel
setup that works for you.

### JSX/Babel

These docs assume you'll be using JSX via Babel. Like React itself, racked-react
works fine without JSX, but JSX can make your work more pleasant.

The sample `package.json` file below should get you started with Babel/JSX,
`nodemon` for running a dev server, and a few helper scripts:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "racked-react": "^0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6",
    "babel-core": "^6",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6",
    "nodemon": "^1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel src -d build",
    "start": "nodemon src/index.js --exec babel-node",
    "serve": "NODE_ENV=production node build/index.js"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### Scripts &amp; Directory Structure

Assuming you're using something like the sample package.json above, your app's
directory structure might look like this:

`src/` => your JSX source code

`build/` => your app's transpiled build, for running in production

In that context, here's what the `scripts` do:

`npm run start` serves your `src` files in development mode.

`npm run build` transpiles your `src` files via babel into your `build` folder.

`npm run serve` serves your transpiled app in production mode.

## Hello, world.

Let's see an app that listens on localhost:3000, and says hello:

```jsx
// src/index.js
const React = require('react');
const { racked, Response } = require('racked-react');

const App = ({ request, response }) => (
  <Response>
    <h1>Hello, world.</h1>
    <p>This request was made at {request.url}.</p>
  </Response>
);

racked(App).listen(3000);
```

### What's happening:

Calling `racked(App)` connects Nodeâ€™s [http server][node-http] to your app, with
node's `request` and `response` objects attached (a) as top-level props, and (b)
to a [React Context][context].

When your App renders, it can use racked-react's utility components to consume
or modify the context, until it eventually renders a `<Response>`.

## A More Interesting Example

This example uses racked-react's `<Hold>` for async I/O, and `<Response>` for
writing finished responses.

`GET => /` returns the current user's name

`PATCH => /` updates the current user.

Calls to the database are fake, but should look familiar if you've ever used
[knex.js][knex].

```jsx
// src/index.js
const React = require('react');
const url = require('url');
const querystring = require('querystring');
const request = require('supertest');
const { Response, Hold, racked } = require('racked-react');

// an app that greets or updates the current user
const App = ({ request }) => (
  <Hold until={fakeAuthenticate(request)}>
    {currentUser => (
      <React.Fragment>
        {request.method === 'GET' && (
          <Response>
            <h1>Hello {currentUser.name}</h1>
          </Response>
        )}
        {request.method === 'PATCH' && (
          <Hold until={fakeUpdate(currentUser, request)}>
            {result => <Response>Updated! New name is {result.name}</Response>}
          </Hold>
        )}
      </React.Fragment>
    )}
  </Hold>
);

const fakeAuthenticate = req => {
  const token = req.headers['Authorization'];
  return fakeDatabase('users')
    .where({ token })
    .first();
};

const fakeUpdate = (user, req) => {
  const { query } = url.parse(req.url);
  const params = querystring.parse(query);
  return fakeDatabase('users')
    .where({ id: user.id })
    .update({
      name: params.name,
    });
};

racked(App).listen(3000);
```

## Component API Reference

### The `<Response>` Component

A `<Response>` is the most important component in the library. You'll render one
`<Response>` each time your app handles a request.

#### `<Response>` Prop Types

| Property | Type       | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| :------- | :--------- | :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| status   | Number     | `200`   | An HTTP status code                                                                                                                                               |
| headers  | Object     | `{}`    | If the client specifies an 'Accept' header, `<Response>` will respect it.                                                                                         |
| body     | String     | `''`    |                                                                                                                                                                   |
| children | React elem |         | Using `children` will override `body` -- useful for rendering long JSX bodies                                                                                     |
| json     | any        |         | Use `json` will override `body` to automatically call JSON.stringify(json) and set the request 'Content-Type' header to 'application/json'                        |
| prefix   | String     |         | Optionally prepend a string to your response -- useful for rendering `<!DOCTYPE html>` or other things JSX doesn't support                                        |
| suffix   | String     |         | Optionally append a string to your response. Useful for nothing I can think of, but the asymmetry of supporting `prefix` without `suffix` would have bothered me. |

#### Status, Headers, Body

As in Ruby's [Rack][rack], a `<Response>` in racked-react is made of an HTTP
status code, some key/value HTTP headers, and a body.

```jsx
const { Response } = require('racked-react');

// sending HTML
const HTMLResponse = () => (
  <Response
    status={200}
    headers={{ 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }}
    body="<h1>Hello, world</h1>"
  />
);
```

#### Implicit status/headers

A `<Response>` sets headers and status by default, so most of the time you won't
need to specify them:

```jsx
// returns an HTTP 200 response with default headers
const Hello = () => <Response body="<h1>Hello, world</h1>" />;
```

#### For HTML: use JSX children instead of `body`

If you're rendering a long HTML body, use JSX children instead of a `body` prop:

```jsx
const LongHello = () => (
  <Response>
    <h1>Hello, world.</h1>
    <p>You look nice today.</p>
  </Response>
);
```

#### For sending full HTML pages, make a `<Layout>` component

If your app responds with full HTML pages, you'll probably want to make a
reusable `<Layout>` component. In this example, `<Layout>` accepts a `title`
prop for setting the page title, and a`children`prop for rendering the contents
of the page `<body>`.

This example also uses the `<Response>` component's `prefix` prop to prepend a
valid HTML5 Doctype to the response. JSX doesn't support rendering <!DOCTYPE> on
its own.

```jsx
const Layout = ({ children, title }) => (
  <Response prefix="<!DOCTYPE html>" headers={{ 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }}>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>{title}</title>
      </head>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  </Response>
);

const App = () => (
  <Layout title="Hello, World">
    <h1>Hello from inside a full HTML document</h1>
  </Layout>
);
```

#### For JSON: use the `json` prop instead of `body`

Instead of setting Content-Type via `headers` and calling `JSON.stringify` on
`body`, you can use the `json` prop to return JSON-encoded data with the correct
Content-Type:

```jsx
cont data = [{ name: 'example' }, { name: 'another example' }];
const JSONResponse = () => <Response json={data} />;
```

### Async I/O with the `<Hold>` Component

Use a `<Hold>` component when you need to asynchronously read or write data.

The `<Hold>` component accepts a promise as a prop, suspends rendering until the
promise resolves, then renders its children with the resolved promise.

```jsx
// use a render prop when you need the result of the promise
const HoldWithRenderProp = () => (
  <Hold until={fetchUsers()}>{users => <Response json={users} />}</Hold>
);

// use regular JSX children when you need to perform an async operation,
// but don't need to render the result
const HoldWithRenderProp = () => (
  <Hold until={deleteEverything()}>
    <Response status={204} body="Deleted everything!" />
  </Hold>
);

// a fake user-fetching function
const fetchUsers = () => fakeDatabase.select('*').from('users');
// a fake delete-everything function
const deleteEverything = () => fakeDatabase('users').truncate();
```

#### `<Hold>` Prop Types

| Property | Type                 | Default                 | Description                                                                                                           |
| :------- | :------------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| until    | Function, Promise    |                         | Accepts either a promise, e.g `knex('users')`, or a function that returns a promise, e.g. `() => knex('users')`.      |
| onError  | Function             | sends an HTTP-500 error | A function of the form `(error, request, response) => {}`                                                             |
| children | Function, React elem |                         | When you need to render the result `until`, use a function as `children`. Otherwise, you can just use React elements. |

#### Composing `<Hold>` with `<Response>`

Render `<Hold>`s outside of `<Response>`. A `<Hold>` _inside_ a `<Response>`
does nothing.

```jsx
// GOOD
<Hold until={somethingHappens}>
  {result => <Response json={result} />}
</Hold>

// Bad
<Response>
  <Hold until={somethingHappens}>{result => '???'}</Hold>
</Response>
```

### Routing

Racked-react can handle Routing on its own, via its `<Branch>` and `<Endpoint>`
components. But if you're already comfortable with [React Router][router], you
can just use that!

#### Routing with React Router

React Router provides a `<StaticRouter>` for use on the server, but doing I/O
usually requires staticlly configuring your routes beforehand, as in [this
gist][static_routes]. So doing I/O means losing some of the advantanges of
dynamic routing.

With racked-react, you can use the `<Hold>` component with `<StaticRouter>` to
handle routing &amp; I/O dynamically:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { StaticRouter, Switch, Route } from 'react-router';
import { Hold, Response, racked } from '../src/index';

// Routing with react router
// <StaticRouter> requires a `context` object -- we'll use it to make
// racked-react's props available to our Routes as props.staticContext
//
// Here's an app that handles Create, Read, Update, Destroy at `/artists`,
// renders a home page at `/`, and 404s at any other route
const App = props => (
  <StaticRouter context={props} location={props.request.url}>
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/artists" component={Artists} />
      <Route exact path="/" render={() => <Response>Home</Response>} />
      <Route render={() => <Response status={404} />} />
    </Switch>
  </StaticRouter>
);

// The Artists component gets rendered by a <Route />, so accepts all the
// standard route props -- match, staticContext, etc
const Artists = ({ match, staticContext }) => {
  const { request } = staticContext;
  return (
    <Switch>
      <Route
        exact
        path={match.url}
        component={request.method === 'POST' ? Create : List}
      />
      <Route
        path={`${match.url}/:id`}
        render={r => (
          <Hold until={findArtist(r.match.params.id)}>
            {artist => (
              <Switch>
                {request.method === 'PATCH' && <Route component={Update} />}
                {request.method === 'DELETE' && <Route component={Destroy} />}
                <Route render={() => <Response body={artist.name} />} />
              </Switch>
            )}
          </Hold>
        )}
      />
    </Switch>
  );
};
// the components that power each route are, for brevity, omitted from this
// example. see docs/routing-with-react-router.test.js for the full code.
```

#### Routing with `<Branch>` and `<Endpoint>`

Documentation forthcoming, see [test/crud/test.js][test] for now.

### The `racked` function

Calling `racked(App)` returns an object with two keys: `listen`, and `handler`:

```js
// calling racked(App) returns =>
{
 // `handler` renders your app with ({ request, response }) as top-level props
  handler: (req, res) => <App request={req} response={res} />,
 // `listen` creates an http.Server and delgates to its `listen` function
  listen: () => http.createServer(handler).listen(arguments)
}
```

If you're using racked-react on its own, you'll probably ignore the `handler`
and just call listen:

```js
const app = racked(App);
app.listen(3000);
```

If you're using racked-react with express.js, you'll use the `handler` to mount
your `racked(App).handler` as middleware. See below for details.

## Use with Express

For apps that do anything useful, you may want access to URL params, a parsed
request body, etc. Using [express.js][express] and some middleware can handle
that for you:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import express from 'express';
import bodyParser from 'body-parser';
import { Response, racked } from 'racked-react';

// an App that echoes back a request's JSON body
const App = ({ request }) => <Response json={request.body} />;

// instantiate express
const server = express();

// mount middleware for parsing JSON request bodies
server.use(bodyParser.json());

// mount our racked(App) as the final middleware
server.use(racked(App).handler);

// start the server
server.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);
```
