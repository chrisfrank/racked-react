# Racked React

Handle HTTP requests in React, with helper components for asynchronous I/O,
HTTP-method-based routing, and more.

## Why?

I love React's declarative, component-based approach to building user
interfaces. Turns out it's also a delightful way to handle HTTP requests.

```jsx
// an app that says hi
const { Response } = require('racked-react');

const App = ({ request }) => (
  <Response status={200} headers={{ 'X-Hello-From': 'racked-react' }}>
    <h1>Hello at {request.url}</h1>
  </Response>
);
```

## Why not?

If your app delivers static HTML and doesn't need to write data, you'll probably
be happier with [next.js][next] or [after.js][after] than with racked-react.

Though you _can_ build static sites in racked-react, it's aimed at building JSON
APIs, traditional CRUD apps, or other I/O-heavy projects. Unlike Next and After,
racked-react lets you asynchronously read and write data on the server, without
statically declaring your routes in advance.

## Installation

Via npm or yarn:

`npm install --save racked-react`

or

`yarn add racked-react`

## Setup

### JSX/Babel

These docs assume you'll be using JSX via Babel. Like React itself, racked-react
works fine without JSX, but it's less pleasant to work with.

The sample `package.json` file below should get you started with Babel/JSX,
nodemon for running a dev server, and a few helper scripts:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "main": "build/index.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "racked-react": "^0.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "babel-cli": "^6",
    "babel-core": "^6",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1",
    "babel-preset-react": "^6",
    "nodemon": "^1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "babel src -d build",
    "start": "nodemon src/index.js --exec babel-node",
    "serve": "NODE_ENV=production node build/index.js"
  },
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

For more advanced setups, I recommend Jared Palmer's [Razzle][razzle] library.

### Scripts &amp; Directory Structure

Assuming you're using something like the sample package.json above, your app's
directory structure might look like this:

`src/` => your JSX source code

`build/` => your app's transpiled build, for running in production

In that context, here's what the `scripts` do:

`npm run start` serves your `src` files in development mode.

`npm run build` transpiles your `src` files via babel into your `build` folder.

`npm run serve` serves your transpiled app in production mode.

## Hello, world.

Let's see an app that listens on localhost:3000, and says hello:

```jsx
// src/index.js
const http = require('http');
const React = require('react');
const { racked, Response } = require('racked-react');

const App = () => (
  <Response>
    <h1>Hello, world.</h1>
  </Response>
);

const server = http.createServer(racked(App));

server.listen(3000);
```

### What's happening:

Calling `racked(App)` connects Nodeâ€™s [http server][node-http] to your app, with
node's `request` and `response` objects attached (a) as top-level props, and (b)
to a [React Context][context].

When your App renders, it can use racked-react's utility components to consume
or modify the context, until it eventually renders a `<Response>`.

## A Kitchen Sink example

This example uses a few of racked-react's utility components: `<Hold>` for async
I/O, `<Endpoint>` for HTTP-method-based routing, and `<Response>` for writing
finished responses.

`GET => /` returns the current user's name `PATCH => /` updates the current user

```jsx
// src/index.js
const http = require('http');
const React = require('react');
const url = require('url');
const querystring = require('querystring');
const request = require('supertest');
const { Response, Hold, Endpoint, racked } = require('racked-react');

// an app that greets or updates the current user
const App = ({ request }) => (
  <Hold until={fakeAuthenticate(request)}>
    {currentUser => (
      <React.Fragment>
        <Endpoint method="GET">
          <Response>
            <h1>Hello {currentUser.name}</h1>
          </Response>
        </Endpoint>
        <Endpoint method="PATCH">
          <Hold until={fakeUpdate(currentUser, request)}>
            {result => <Response>Updated! New name is {result.name}</Response>}
          </Hold>
        </Endpoint>
      </React.Fragment>
    )}
  </Hold>
);

const fakeAuthenticate = req => {
  const token = req.headers['Authorization'];
  return Promise.resolve(
    fakeDatabase('users')
      .where({ token })
      .first()
  );
};

const fakeUpdate = (user, req) => {
  const qs = url.parse(req.url).query;
  const params = querystring.parse(qs);
  return Promise.resolve(
    fakeDatabase('users')
      .where({ id: user.id })
      .update({
        name: params.name,
      })
  );
};

const fakeDatabase = () => ({
  where: () => fakeDatabase(),
  update: ({ name }) => ({ name }),
  first: () => ({ name: 'James T. Kirk' }),
});

const server = http.createServer(racked(App));

server.listen(3000);
```

## The `<Response>` Component

A `<Response>` is the most important component in the library. You'll render a
`<Response>` each time your app handles a request.

As in Ruby's [Rack][rack], a `<Response>` in racked-react is made of an HTTP
status code, some key/value HTTP headers, and a body. Most of the time you won't
need to explicitly specify all those things, but here's how you would:

### Status, Headers, Body

```jsx
const { Response } = require('racked-react');

// sending HTML
const HTMLResponse = () => (
  <Response
    status={200}
    headers={{ 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }}
    body="<h1>Hello, world</h1>"
  />
);
```

### Implicit status/headers

A `<Response>` sets headers and status by default, so most of the time you won't
need to specify them:

```jsx
// returns an HTTP 200 response with default headers
const Hello = () => <Response body="<h1>Hello, world</h1>" />;
```

### Best-practice for HTML: use JSX children instead of `body`

If you're rendering a long HTML body, use JSX children instead of a `body` prop:

```jsx
const LongHello = () => (
  <Response>
    <h1>Hello, world.</h1>
    <p>You look nice today.</p>
  </Response>
);
```

### Best-practice for JSON: use the `json` prop instead of `body`

Instead of setting Content-Type via `headers` and calling `JSON.stringify` on
`body`, you can use the `json` prop to return JSON-encoded data with the correct
Content-Type:

```jsx
cont data = [{ name: 'example' }, { name: 'another example' }];
const JSONResponse = () => <Response json={data} />;
```

## Async I/O with the `<Hold>` Component

TODO

## Routing

Racked-react can handle Routing entirely on its own, via its `<Branch>` and
`<Endpoint>` components. But if you're already comfortable with [React
Router][router], you can use that instead, optionally composed with an
`<Endpoint>` when you need to restrict a route to just a particular HTTP-method,
like POST, GET, or DELETE.
